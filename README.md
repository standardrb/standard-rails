# standard-rails

This gem provides a [lint_roller](https://github.com/standardrb/lint_roller)
plugin configuration for the
[rubocop-rails](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rails) ruleset, for use
as an extension to the [Standard Ruby
gem](https://github.com/standardrb/standard).

To install it, you'll want to start by adding it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "standard-rails"
```

## Configuration

In your `.standard.yml` file, you can simply list `standard-rails` as a plugin:

```yaml
plugins:
  - standard-rails
```

Even though it'll usually be inferred automatically, you can specify the exact
version of Rails you want the rules to run against by converting the string to
a nested hash:

```yaml
plugins:
  - standard-rails:
      target_rails_version: 7.0
```

### Rubocop

If you're using Rubocop, you'll want to inherit from the `standard-rails` gem in your `rubocop.yml` file. Here's an example:

```yaml
require:
  - rubocop-rails
  - standard
  - standard-rails

inherit_gem:
  standard: config/base.yml
  standard-rails: config/base.yml
```
